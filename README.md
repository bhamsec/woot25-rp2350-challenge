# WOOT25 RP2350 Challenge

This repository is a meta repository to hold the artifacts related to the paper "Security through Transparency: Tales from the RP2350 Hacking Challenge", published at WOOT'25.

The paper showcases several attacks against a secure-boot enabled rp2350 chip, all developed independent of each other.
This meta repository links to the different attack implementations as submodules.

Additional details can be found in our [paper](woot25-rp2350-security-challenge.pdf).
Each submodule corresponds to the according subsection of `Section 4. Attacks` in the paper.
